              <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

                <p>
                  <span class=specialfont>I’ve been in love with art and design</span> since the day I picked up my first crayon. Constantly drawing, doodling and making things as I grew up, I always knew that I wanted to pursue a creative career. I also
                  discovered a love for technology, brought out by the world of MySpace, where I would spend hours each day studying the code and figuring out how to mold and edit it to create the perfect layout and design for my page. I loved the feeling
                  of being able to transform the site however I chose and felt so empowered knowing what I did about code and technology at such a young age.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <span class=specialfont>Little did I know, but this early exposure to computers would lead to my current career passion – computer aided design… specifically web design.</span>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  When I attended Syracuse University, I chose Communications Design as my intended major. I loved the idea of creating everything from logos (like I did in middle school, though much better ones), to editorial to package designs,
                  and melding my love for art with my designs. During my two years there, I found a fervor for my work and I learned that I have an eye for color, and a mind for creating unique ideas and solutions, that only years of doodling and imagining
                  could have taught, but there was something missing. I wanted more technology and more interactivity in my designs. I wanted my art to be more than just an image. I wanted it to have a kind of life to it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  I took a few-year hiatus from school, where I continued researching design, taught myself many different programs, and found that I long for more of a challenge. I wanted to delve deeper into the process of design. I finally
                  found my calling in web design, through an online apprenticeship with Bloc.io.

            <div class="secondcolumn">
              <img src="images/selfie.png" class="selfie"></div>

              <p class="font2">
                <span class=specialfont>Now, I am able to fuse my love for creativity, with a more analytical, in-depth approach to the process.</span>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                I found an intense passion for the ever-changing technology that comes with web design. I believe passionate design is the best design. As a self-taught artist, I am always finding inspiration in the colors of everyday life.
                I find my experience working as a waitress, has given me a deeper understanding of people, and what they want. I think design is all about connecting with people, and that is my goal in all of my work. I want to discover what will get people
                excited, and create beautiful, imaginative solutions for complex problems. I’m a firm believer in the power of a strong concept with an unexpected execution and with these beliefs in mind, I challenge myself to explore with every project.
                My work is rooted in research, iteration, and open dialogue, and when given the opportunity to form concepts from beginning to end, I found, I thrive.
              </p>

                <span class=specialfont>Hopefully my site has given you a good overview of what I can do!</span>
