    <!-- PROBLEM & SOLUTION -->




    <section id="part1">
      <div class="ps">

        <h2 class="problem">PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          While there are several friend-finding apps on the market, as well as a few meet-up type apps, there are really no sites that combine the two, and give users venues and events to meet new people.. There is also a lack of friending apps that allow users
          to match based on interests.
        </p>

        <h2 class="solution">SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          Amigo addresses these issues by allowing users to search for groups and events they might be interested in, as one way to meet new people there, or even invite new “amigos” to join them. Users are also able to filter their searches based on interests
          as well as location, sex and age, therefore eliminating users who they don’t deem interesting.
        </p>

        <h2 class="connection">MY INSPIRATION</h2>
        <p>
          Amigo is an app that was designed based on my own passions. I am always looking for fun clubs and groups to join, but I’ve found it’s hard to join sports leagues without creating your own team. Being fairly new to the city of Pittsburgh, this is difficult
          for me. I only really know people I work with, and they don’t necessarily share the same interests as me. As I explored apps like Meetup and Bumble BFF, I found gaps that needed to be filled, that Amigo is designed to solve, such as groups with
          people my own age, or figuring out things to do once you match with a new “friend.”

          Finally, based on my preference tests, usability tests and some other feedback I received, I was able to refine the designs. I mostly adjusted smaller details to improve readability, navigation and clarity in my mobile application.

          I made the buttons stand out more by applying the bright gradient as the background, in order to make the button seem more active. I got eliminated the search and home pages to simplify the app, and I labeled the navigation icons, to better clarify the meaning of each.

          I removed the distracting diagonal opacities from the background, and changed the button style to match other existing button styles throughout the app. “Next” and “finish” buttons were also added to the onboarding pages, rather than the forward arrows at the top, making the navigation more straight-forward. I also, de-emphasized the skip button.

              This is my favorite project, so far. I had so much freedom to be creative and really explore different style techniques. I really took to mind all of the feedback I received from the testing I did and critiques I recieved. I always enjoying hearing user feedback, to see things from different views, like styles and navigation systems, and trying to understand why people like things a certain way.
              <br><br>
              Though I had a few struggles throughout the project, like trying to figure out what flow would work best in an app like this, and deciding on colors and styles, I was able to grow and learn by making decisions and testing them afterward. I started out, like always, with so many ideas of what the app should feature, look like, and how things should work. After flipping between my user stories and flows, I was able to narrow down the navigation, and from there, simplify it as I went. I wanted to make sure my app was different enough from other friending apps, and stood out. I learned that starting with a strong concept is important when designing an app like this, and it is important to fully research what the competitors are doing right and wrong. If I had more time, I would like to explore more unique features to add to my application.
              <br><br>
              I was surprised how quickly my mockups and visual design came together. I am extremely happy with how all of my hard work paid off and how my designs turned out. They show the clean, minimalist yet vibrant look that represents my style as a designer, and I think it is an app that I would likely use if it were on the market, not only to find friends, but to find fun events and groups to attend.
