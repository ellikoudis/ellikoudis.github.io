        <h2 class="problem">PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>There are many cloud storage sites on the market, but there is a gap where creation and creativity meet. There are no sites built for creatives that provide inspiration in the workplace while giving access to all the tools they need to create.</p>

        <h2 class="solution">SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>SparkSpace becomes a new kind of cloud storage space where creativity rules. This is a site designed for creatives who want to do everything all in one place; upload, organize, create, discover, save, and share. They are able to access their work
          easily and work more efficiently by having one space that meets all of their needs, that fuels their creativity.</p>

        different functions. I spent a lot of time on these user flows, trying to simplify my complex design ideas.

            This brand has a unique color gradient that I think lends to the modern and fun style of the brand. I used gradients of blues, purples and turquois in my design. the color blue I used has a sense of energy to it, but also gives a kind of calm feeling
            while the purple emits feelings of creativity and imagination and the turquoise adds that sense of fun. Black and white are dominating colors as well, as they create a very modern look and feel to the site while giving that power and elegance
            to it as well. There are shades of greys and accents of purples, and blues.

            These first iterations were overly designed and a little hard on the eyes. I receive feedback and critiques that were very helpful in simplifying my designs. I wanted a more clean, modern feel, with less gradient and a lot less going on.
            <br><br> I created a few different variations which I tested with users.

          <p>
            Based on the feedback received from my preference tests and other opinions, I was able to make edits to my designs. I decided to use the gradient as a bold background or navbar color and let the rest of the page be dominantly white, to help create the
            modern, minimalist look and feel I was going for.

          <p class="mocktype">
            My landing page design changed quite a bit. I wanted to create more of an insentive to become a user of sparkspace, so i made little illustrations showing what users could do with the site, as well as adding the gradient wave with the subscriptions. This
            allowed me to eliminate some of the buttons at the top of the page as well.

          <p class="mocktype2">
            I followed the same process of toning down all the excessive gradients and minimalizing unnecessary elements and buttons. To create my minimalist feel, I got rid of outlines around everything and scaled down the font sizes.

          <h2 class="proto2">PROTOTYPING</h2>

          <p>
            It was now time to create a testable prototype which I tested a few times with different users to make sure it was easily navigable and had a nice flow. It allowed me to tweak the design as well and make little changes, like adding “back” buttons to different
            pages.
            <br><br> I received a lot of feedback about my design from different students and by participating in live, group, design sessions, where i was able to get a more in-depth critique. I learned that some of my buttons were repetitive and unnecessary,
            while some were confusing, and I needed to fix navigation issues. I also got a lot of feedback to condense different elements, since I tend to over-design at times. This was my favorite feedback so far, because it was from other designers
            and students like myself.

        <div class="movefinaltype">
          <p class="finaltype">
            SparkSpace was such a fun project to work on. I was able to have a hands-on approach to the entire process of researching, information architecture, branding and visual design, and user testing, which was new to me, coming from a graphic design and art
            backgound. I learned that user feedback was vital to the design of the site, as I got to see what different people thought worked in the design and layout of the site, and what needed improvement, so that my final iterations would be successful.
            This was something I wasn’t used to either, but really helped me critique my work in new ways.

            <br><br> I definitely had my struggles throughout the project, but I was able to overcome the struggles and really grow and learn by trial and error. It was so satisfying seeing all of my hard work come together to create a fun, modern, clean
            design. this project was one of my favorites to work on, because I believe in the content of the site and I was so excited to create something that I would want to use everyday for my own designs.
