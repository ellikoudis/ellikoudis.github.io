  <!-- PROBLEM & SOLUTION -->

    <div class="problemsection">
          <h2 class="problem">PROBLEM</h2>
          <p class="aboutproblem">There are many cloud storage sites on the market, but there is a gap where creation and creativity meet. There are no sites built for creatives that provide inspiration in the workplace while giving access to all the tools they need to create.</p>

          <h2 class="solution">SOLUTION</h2>
          <p class="aboutsolution">SparkSpace becomes a new kind of cloud storage space where creativity rules. This is a site designed for creatives who want to do everything all in one place; upload, organize, create, discover, save, and share. They are able to access their work easily and work more efficiently by having one space that meets all of their needs, that fuels their creativity.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Research & Discovery -->

  <h3 class=heading1>RESEARCH & DISCOVERY</h3>

  <div class="hl2"></div>

<h2 class="usersurveys">USER SURVEYS</h2>
<p class="aboutsurveys">I created two surveys to discover what users were looking for in a cloud storage site, what their current sites were lacking, and what would be beneficial to them on a daily basis. </p>

<table class="surveyrow">
<div class="surveycolumn">
<h4 class="survey1">SURVEY 1:</h4>
<p class="firstsurvey">Designed to find out about what users like and prefer in their cloud storage sites. <br>

I discovered that they want something that is easy to use that is great for sharing files, giving presentations, and connecting with coworkers more easily.</p>

<div class="movesurv">
<img src="images/survey1.png" alt="survey1img "height="550px">
</div>

<p class="firstsurvey2">This survey didn’t provide me with all of the information I needed, so I decided to follow up with a second survey, specifically designed for people in the creative industry, who rely on inpiration and creativity on a daily basis.</p>
</div>

  <div class="vl3"></div>

<div class="surveycolumn">
<h4 class="survey2">SURVEY 2:</h4>
<p class="secondsurvey">Aimed toward people in the creative industry.<br>

I asked questions like: “does your current cloud service inspire creativity in the workplace,” and “what would you like your cloud service to provide more of in your workplace?”</p>

<div class="movesurv">
  <img src="images/survey2.png" alt="survey2img" height="550px">

<div class="takeawayall">
  <h4 class="keytakeaways">KEY TAKEAWAYS:</h4>

</div>


<h2 class="companalysis">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
<p class="aboutcomp">The next step in researching was to discover the competition and analyze what they are doing well and where they are falling short, to discover where a new competitor might fit in.</p>
